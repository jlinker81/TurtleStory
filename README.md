## About

Turtle Story is a game about a pet turtle and his wacky antics. It is used to ease coding-adverse humanities students into learning how to code. To incorporate this game into your digital humanities class, read the article "Turtle Story: The Irreverent Turtle Twine Game That Taught Humanists to Code," in _Entwine_. The general gist of the exercise is to have humanities students observe and describe the game mechanics after playing a few times, so that they have mastered how the game works before an instructor reveals and explains the syntax.
